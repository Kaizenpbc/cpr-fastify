## Migration History

All migrations are defined in `backend/src/config/migrations.ts` and tracked in the `schema_migrations` table. Migrations run automatically at server startup.

| Version | Name | Description |
|---------|------|-------------|
| 1 | create_login_attempts | Creates the `login_attempts` table with index on (username, attempted_at) for rate limiting |
| 2 | create_token_blacklist | Creates the `token_blacklist` table for JWT invalidation |
| 3 | create_invoice_number_sequences | Creates the `invoice_number_sequences` table with FK to organizations |
| 4 | fix_token_blacklist_add_invalidated_at | Adds `invalidated_at` column to token_blacklist (idempotent) |
| 5 | create_students_master | Creates the `students` master table with unique email index and org FK |
| 6 | add_student_id_to_course_students | Adds `student_id` column and FK to course_students linking to students master |
| 7 | backfill_students_master | Programmatic migration: deduplicates course_students by email, creates master student records, and links existing course_students to their master records |
| 8 | add_certification_expiry_tracking | Adds `certification_validity_months` column to class_types |
| 9 | add_certificate_fields_to_course_students | Adds `certificate_number`, `certificate_issued_at`, `certificate_expires_at` to course_students with index on expiry date |
| 10 | backfill_certificate_dates | Programmatic migration: for attended students in completed courses where the class type has a validity period, sets certificate_issued_at and certificate_expires_at |
| 11 | create_system_config | Creates the `system_config` key-value table and seeds the HST tax rate |
| 12 | create_certification_reminders | Creates the `certification_reminders` table for tracking sent cert expiry reminders |
| 13 | create_audit_logs | Creates the `audit_logs` table with indexes on created_at, user_id, and (entity_type, entity_id) |

**Notes:**
- The migration runner automatically creates the `schema_migrations` tracking table if it does not exist.
- Migrations are idempotent and use `IF NOT EXISTS` / `IF NOT EXISTS` guards where possible.
- After migrations complete, old login_attempts (older than 1 hour) are automatically purged.
- Many tables (users, organizations, class_types, course_requests, invoices, payments, etc.) are assumed to be created by an initial SQL schema or seed script outside the versioned migration system. The migration system handles incremental schema changes only.
